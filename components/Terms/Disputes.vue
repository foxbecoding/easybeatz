            These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or {{company_name}}. 
            {{company_name}} may terminate these Terms (including any additional terms and conditions incorporated herein) 
            or suspend your access to the {{company_name}} Service at any time if we believe you have breached 
            any of these Terms, if we stop providing the {{company_name}} Service or any material component 
            thereof, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law. 
            If you or {{company_name}} terminate these Terms, or if {{company_name}} suspends your 
            access to the {{company_name}} Service, you agree that {{company_name}} shall have no 
            liability or responsibility to you, and (except as expressly provided in these Terms) 
            {{company_name}} will not refund any amounts that you have already paid. You may terminate these 
            Terms at any time, in which case you may not continue accessing or using the {{company_name}} Service. 
            To learn how to terminate your {{company_name}} account, please use the Customer Support resources 
            on our About Us page.
